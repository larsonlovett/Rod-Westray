During interphase, which takes up about 95 percent of the duration of the eukaryotic cell cycle, cells grow and replicate their dna in preparation for mitosis. The dna duplicates during interphase to prepare for . Originally this phase of the cell cycle . Interphase is the phase of the cell cycle in which a typical cell spends most of its life. The interphase is the preparation phase for mitosis and it is also the longest phase in the cell cycle.
The three main phases of a single cell cycle are: The interphase is the preparation phase for mitosis and it is also the longest phase in the cell cycle. During interphase, which takes up about 95 percent of the duration of the eukaryotic cell cycle, cells grow and replicate their dna in preparation for mitosis.
